## 2026-03-31 - [Optimized Iteration over large collections]
**Learning:** Found an opportunity to replace chained array methods like flatMap, map, reduce, and Object.values/keys with single-pass manual 'for' and 'for...in' loops when processing arrays and objects to avoid allocating large temporary data structures. Used ES6 Maps/Sets where efficient counting/deduplication was needed.
**Action:** Apply this pattern to other performance sensitive areas where objects and arrays map over large datasets, and ensure that iteration checks 'Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()' when utilizing 'for...in'. Note: This project lacks a package.json at the root so standard npm/pnpm lint tools might not be readily available.

## 2024-04-15 - [Avoid O(N log N) Sorting on Massive Geographical Collections]
**Learning:** In spatial queries like `findNearbyStations` where we scan `railwayData` containing thousands of stations to find the top K nearest points, allocating all elements to an array and running `Array.prototype.sort()` results in massive temporary object allocation and $O(N \log N)$ execution time (taking ~8.5ms in benchmarks).
**Action:** Replace full array sorts with a bounded Top-K array using a simple $O(K)$ insertion sort during the $O(N)$ iteration phase. This brings the time complexity effectively down to $O(N)$, speeding up operations by ~36x (taking ~0.24ms). Remember to apply a final sort if total elements found are less than $K$.

## 2026-05-03 - [Avoid Expensive Visual Path Generation for Aggregates]
**Learning:** In operations that calculate aggregate statistics over massive lists of data (e.g. total distance across all user trips), calculating visual or rendering-related properties (like SVG paths, rotations, or bounding boxes) for every element causes severe linear slowdowns. Generating data that is ultimately discarded puts pressure on garbage collection and blocks the thread unnecessarily.
**Action:** Always decouple statistical aggregations (like distance) from presentation-layer computations (like SVG generation), or pass a flag to bypass the visual logic entirely when aggregating statistics.
